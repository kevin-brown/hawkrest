Hawk lets two parties securely communicate with each other using
messages signed by a shared key.
It is based on `HTTP MAC access authentication`_ (which
was based on parts of `OAuth 1.0`_).

HawkREST uses the `mohawk`_ module to add Hawk
authorization to your REST API views.

This guide will help you set everything up but you should
also read through `mohawk security considerations`_ to get familiar
with the security aspects of Hawk.

Installation
============

Requirements:

* Python 2.7+ or 3.4+
* `Django`_ 1.8 through 1.11, 2.0 through 2.1
* `Django Rest Framework`_ 3.4 through 3.9
* `mohawk`_

(Older versions of these libraries may work, but support is not guaranteed.)

Using `pip`_, install the module like this::

    pip install hawkrest

This will also install all necessary dependencies.
You'll most likely put this in a `requirements`_ file within your Django app.

Changelog
=========

.. important::
    If you're upgrading from a version prior to 0.0.6, be sure to
    use ``rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated`` on your views
    :ref:`as documented <protecting-api-views>`

- **1.0.1 (2018-10-06)**
  - Added support for being used via Django 1.11's new `MIDDLEWARE` option.
  - Fixed the ``hawkrequest`` management command when using newer Django/Python.
  - Fixed inconsistency between the way the middleware and authentication
    backend determined whether a request was a Hawk signed request.

- **1.0.0 (2017-04-05)**

  - Added support for a ``HAWK_USER_LOOKUP`` setting.
    See :ref:`usage`.
  - Added hooks to make subclassing ``HawkAuthentication`` easier.
    See :ref:`usage`.
  - Dropped support for Django 1.6/1.7.
  - Dropped support for django-rest-framework 3.2/3.3.
  - Confirmed support for django-rest-framework 3.4/3.5.
  - Added support for Django 1.10/1.11.
  - Started using `semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>`_.

- **0.0.10** (2016-06-01)

  - Adds support for Django 1.9.

- **0.0.9** (2016-01-07)

  - Adds more specific ``AuthenticationFailed`` errors.

- **0.0.8** (2015-10-01)

  - Fixes `issue #11 <https://github.com/kumar303/hawkrest/issues/11>`_
    where exception info was leaked to the response, potentially revealing
    sensitive information.

- **0.0.7** (2015-09-30)

  - Fixes `issue #9 <https://github.com/kumar303/hawkrest/issues/9>`_
    where using ``rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated``
    on your Hawk protected view caused an unexpected traceback.

- **0.0.6** (2015-09-08)

  - **IMPORTANT**: If migrating to this version from an earlier version of
    ``hawkrest``, your Django Rest Framework API views *must* require an
    authenticated user :ref:`as documented <protecting-api-views>`. In other
    words, older versions of ``hawkrest`` would reject any request that didn't
    have a Hawk authentication header but this version does not (see the bug fix
    below).
  - Fixed bug where other HTTP authorization schemes could not be supported at
    the same time as Hawk. Thanks to
    `Mauro Doglio <https://github.com/maurodoglio>`_ for the patch.
  - Fixed incorrect statement in docs that Python 2.6 was supported. Only 2.7 or
    greater is supported at this time.
  - Sends ``WWW-Authenticate: Hawk`` header in 401 responses now.

- **0.0.5** (2015-07-21)

  - Fixed nonce callback support for
    `mohawk 0.3.0 <https://mohawk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#changelog>`_.
    Thanks to Josh Wilson for the patches.

    Thanks to wolfgangmeyers for the patch.

- **0.0.1** (2014-02-27)

  - Initial release, extracted from https://github.com/mozilla/apk-signer
